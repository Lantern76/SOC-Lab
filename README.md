# SOC-Lab
This is a SOC focused home lab that will use a variety of tools including Sliver to simulate an attack on a vulnerable machine and monitor said attack from a security platform. During this lab steps will be taken to monitor and secure the vulnerable system to ensure similar attacks wont happen again.
