# SOC-Lab
This is a SOC focused home lab that will use a variety of tools including Sliver to simulate an attack on a vulnerable machine. During this lab the vulberable machine is the Windows VM, attacking machine will be a Kali Linux, and the monitoring tool will be LimaWire. 

# As a disclaimer, the original idea for this lab comes from Eric Capuano. Setting up the lab environment has been purposefully left out and I highly suggest anyone interested in replicating this lab visity his Substack page(linked below)!

# SOC-Lab

## Objective

The SOC Lab is designed to showcase my skills in a simulated real world environment with an attacker(Linux) and Defender(Windows). The SOC home lab is designed to simulate real-world cybersecurity environments, allowing me to practice identifying, investigating, and mitigating cyber threats in a controlled setting. Its primary objective is to provide hands-on experience with security tools, techniques, and processes, helping me to develop practical skills in network monitoring, threat detection, and response strategies. Additionally, it aims to foster a deeper understanding of the cybersecurity landscape, including the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers. By recreating the challenges faced by professional SOCs, this home lab serves as a valuable educational platform for an aspiring cybersecurity professional, such as myself, enhancing my readiness for careers in the rapidly evolving field of information security.
### Skills Learned

- Learning to identify and analyze potential security threats in network traffic and logs, using tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems.
- Developing the skills necessary to effectively respond to and manage security incidents, including containment strategies, eradication of threats, and recovery processes.
- Gaining experience in monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity and conducting forensic analysis to understand the nature and impact of security breaches.
- Learning about the development and implementation of security policies and best practices to protect organizational assets and data.
- Acquiring the ability to use threat intelligence feeds and sources to anticipate and defend against potential cyber attacks, understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by cybercriminals

### Tools Used


- WireShark for capturing and analyzing network traffic on Windows/Linux systems. 
- Linux terminal for utilizng command line tools including nmap and ifconfig.
- Network Miner to extract artifacts and capture network PCAP files.
